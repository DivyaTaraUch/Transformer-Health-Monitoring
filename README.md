# Transformer-Health-Monitoring
Problem Statement:-
Transformer is a vital building block in a power system and any damages in
transformers adversely affects the balance of a power system. The damages are
mainly occurring due to overloading and inefficient cooling. The main
objective of the project is real time monitoring of the health conditions of the
distribution transformer using IOT technology. The parameters such as
temperature, voltage, oil level and current of a transformer are monitored,
processed and recorded in MathWorks server.
